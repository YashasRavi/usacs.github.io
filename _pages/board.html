          <p class="title">President</p>
          <p>I'm Archi Parekh and I'm a junior majoring in computer science with minors in Economics and South Asian Studies. As president of USACS, I enjoy working to foster an inclusive and supportive computer science community. In the past, I've interned at Cognition IP, a law-tech startup, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I'm also involved with the Gardner Fellowship at Rutgers, where I explore political, economic, and societal factors behind technology. Recently, I've been interested in data journalism and public interest tech. In my free time, I enjoy baking, doing yoga, and watching Marvel movies. I'm super excited to get to know everyone this year! Hit me up on Facebook, Discord, LinkedIn, or email (archiparekh23@gmail.com)!          </p>
